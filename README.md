If you are planning for CAT Preparation 2026, now is the perfect time to start your journey. With the right strategy, consistent practice, and expert guidance, cracking CAT with a high percentile is absolutely possible.

Logical thinking

Quantitative aptitude

Reading comprehension

Data interpretation

Time management

Starting early gives you enough time to:

Build strong fundamentals

Practice mocks regularly

Improve weak areas

Avoid last-minute stress

With CAT 2026 expected in November 2026, starting now ensures you stay ahead of the competition.

CAT Exam Pattern Overview (2026)

CAT consists of three sections:

1. VARC – Verbal Ability & Reading Comprehension

Tests reading skills, grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension ability.

2. DILR – Data Interpretation & Logical Reasoning

Includes puzzles, graphs, arrangements, caselets, and logical sets.

3. QA – Quantitative Aptitude

Covers arithmetic, algebra, geometry, number system, and modern math.

Each section requires a different preparation style, and that’s why expert coaching can make a big difference.
